# Octodemo

A demonstration of how Octopress might be structured such that:

1. It can be used as a gem.
2. Plugins are gems, and can be used from Github or as properly published gems.
3. Plugins can include gem dependencies into an Octopress project, and extend
   the set of CLI tools available to the user.
